I used HTML5, CSS (and SASS!), Javascript and jQuery 2.1.3 to create my game. As my first project, I took time to think through how I wanted the game to operate and drew very basic wireframes. I then jumped into coding, starting with the basics first: from taking the players names, to displaying the first round, to checking answers, to iterating through all of the rounds, etc. The first major challenge was thinking through all of the possibilities of player responses and what they should trigger. For example, if player one gets the answer wrong, what happens to player two? What if neither player elects to answer?

The second, and far more complex challenge, was the issue of timers. Figuring out how to load the countdown timers and to *reset* them various times, over and over, proved to be quite complicated. Setting the internal timer to move the page along when there was inaction also took some careful thought, to make sure that I was clearing these timers when necessary.

I eliminated a variety of other bugs during testing, including case-sensitivity, the ENTER key causing the page to refresh, unclosed event listeners and more.

Ultimately, I am quite pleased with the finished product. However, if I wasn't worried about copyrights, I would have much preferred to play clips of the songs. :D

I hope you enjoy playing!
